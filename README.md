# nubpaws.github.io
A work in progress website meant to display my projects and other random things I do.

Site can be viewed on github.io pages at [nubpaws.github.io](https://nubpaws.github.io).

# Resources
- [Math Jax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for rendering beautiful, crisp, latex code.
- [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for pretty syntax coloring in code blocks.
