  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I have created a thread pool in C++ and in this article I will present and explain the code.</p>
  <p>
    Before I begin, I will state that the original code I used is heavily based off of
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15752659/thread-pooling-in-c11/32593825#32593825">
      this StackOverflow answer from PhD AP EcE
    </a>.
    If you are interested in the original, and a more simple thread pool that just works - his answer
    is perfect.
  </p>
  <p>The original answer could only accept jobs that are a void function, that receives no arguments.</p>
  <p>
    My goal was to make that thread pool much more modular, being able to accept different kinds of
    functions and and function signatures (all returning void, but that can be changed easily though not
    really needed with threads).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are interested in just getting the file, you can do so
    <a href="../files/cpp-thread-pool/ThreadPool.hpp">here</a> and it is also available on
    <a href="">my GitHub</a> with a working example (which I will present here as well).
  </p>
</section>

<section id="how-to-use-it">
  <h1>How to use it</h1>

  <p>
    A full main file example using the code <a href="../files/cpp-thread-pool/Program.cpp">can be found here</a>.
    Note that the code uses a <em>very basic</em> thread safe queue to handle the printing. That class
    <code>QueueTS.hpp</code> <a href="../files/cpp-thread-pool/QueueTS.hpp">can be found here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll be assuming you know why you need a thread pool in the first place. My example will be a simple one
    in which we'll be summing a large array.
    We first create the function we want to execute on each of our threads. I have created the following function:
  </p>

<pre><code>void partialSum(
  const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; ns,
  size_t start,
  size_t end,
  long long&amp; result
) {
  result = std::accumulate(ns.begin() + start, ns.begin() + end, 0LL);
  
  std::stringstream s;
  s &lt;&lt; "Summed from " &lt;&lt; start
    &lt;&lt; " to " &lt;&lt; end
    &lt;&lt; " and got a total of " &lt;&lt; result
    &lt;&lt; " on thread " &lt;&lt; std::this_thread::get_id();
  printQueue.push(s.str());
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    <code>partialSum</code> simply sums a part of the <code>std::vector</code>. We will have a big array in
    our <code>main</code> function, specifically of size $2^{20}$ which is approx. a million. We'll:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Split it into 64 partial sums.</li>
    <li>Run all the partial sums on 4 threads.</li>
    <li>Wait for them to finish.</li>
    <li>Sum the 64 partial sums in the main thread.</li>
    <li>Output the actual sum (by doing the full sum) and the sum of the partial sums.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Again, the full code can be seen above. We have a function called <code>fillWithRandomNumbers</code> that does what
    it says to an <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;&</code> passed to it. We also have a thread safe <code>QueueTS.hpp</code>
    file we use for the printing which is global.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's our main function:
  </p>
<pre><code>const size_t SIZE = 2 &lt;&lt; 20;
std::vector&lt;int&gt; numbers(SIZE);

fillWithRandomNumbers(numbers);

// Create a thread pool with 4 threads.
ThreadPool&lt;4, const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&, size_t, size_t, long long&&gt; pool;

// We want to split our code into 64 smaller chunks.
const size_t tasks = 64;
const size_t taskCount = SIZE / tasks;

std::array&lt;long long, tasks&gt; results;
for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; tasks; i++) {
  results[i] = 0;
  pool.queue(partialSum, numbers, taskCount * i, taskCount * (i + 1), results[i]);
}

pool.start();
while (pool.busy()) {
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50));
}
pool.join();

std::cout &lt;&lt; "Result is:     "
  &lt;&lt; std::accumulate(results.begin(), results.end(), 0LL)
  &lt;&lt; "\n";
std::cout &lt;&lt; "Actual sum is: "
  &lt;&lt; std::accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 0LL)
  &lt;&lt; "\n";
std::cout &lt;&lt; "-----------------------------------------------------\n";
while (!printQueue.empty()) &lcub;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; printQueue.pop() &lt;&lt; "\n";
&rcub;</code></pre>

  <p>
    The main thing to focus on is our creation of the thread, in which we are passing the number
    of threads we are interested in, and the argument types the function is expecting to get.
    This gives us all the flexibility we might be interested in as we get to call any kind of
    function we want (that returns <code>void</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    We should also look at the API. We can see that our thread pool supports the methods
    <code>queue</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>busy</code> and <code>join</code>.
    These methods are enough for us to handle our threads. Whereas <code>join</code> tells all threads
    to stop execution of their current task and terminate, without executing any more tasks. <code>start</code>
    starts running the thread, meaning there's an inner thread pool loop in the class.
  </p>
  <p>We'll be building all of those functions.</p>
</section>

<section id="lets-build-a-thread-pool">
  <h1>Let's build a Thread Pool</h1>
  
  <p>
    First thing we'll define is our signature, so we'll know what we have to implement. Here's the
    layout of our class:
  </p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;mutex&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;
#include &lt;condition_variable&gt;
#include &lt;queue&gt;
#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;optional&gt;
#include &lt;tuple&gt;

template&lt;size_t threadCount, typename... Args&gt;
class ThreadPool &lcub;
public:
  typedef std::function&lt;void(Args...)&gt; Function;
  
  struct Job;
  
private:
  bool shouldTerminate = false;
  
  std::mutex queueMutex;
  std::condition_variable mutexCondition;
  
  std::array&lt;threadCount, std::thread&gt; threads;
  std::queue&lt;Job&gt; jobs;
  
public:
  ThreadPool() = default;
  
  ~ThreadPool();
  
  void start();
  void queue(const Function&amp; func, Args... args);
  void join();
  bool busy();
  
private:
  void loop();
  std::optional&lt;Job&gt; getNextJob();
&rcub;&semi;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    As you can tell we have quite a bit to cover, we'll implement the code from top to bottom in
    this article for the sake of order.
  </p>
  <section id="templated-class">
    <h2>Templated Class</h2>
    <p>
      If you are unfamiliar with templated class, or just not used to them, the definition here
      can be a bit a lot so let's look at it carefully.
    </p>
    <pre><code>template&lt;size_t threadCount, typename... Args&gt; class ThreadPool</code></pre>
    <p>
      First, I'll remind that the templated information is passed to the class when creating as
      <code>ThreadPool&lt;4, int, float&gt;</code>. The first argument we are receiving is the
      number of threads that we want to have. The idea of a thread pool is that we have a few threads
      that keep executing tasks, so we can have 1 million tasks, but still have a low number of
      context switches and a low number of thread overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part is easy enough to understand. If you are unfamiliar with C++ templates, then yes,
      you can pass arguments like that and they will be passed as is, if you pass a number, the compiler will
      replace all occurances with that number and if you pass a variable, the compiler will replace all
      occurances with that variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next part is the more tricky part. What we are saying is that, from here on out, you can pass
      as many types as you want into the template and we'll store them all in <code>Args</code>.
      This is all the part says, and it just looks a bit scary. This is the trick to let us have a lot
      of flexibility while creating thread pools.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="thread-pool-job">
    <h2><code>ThreadPool::Job</code></h2>
    <p>
      This is the part that is the most different from the original. I have defined a custom job struct
      for each function. The job struct is defined as such:
    </p>
<pre><code>struct Job &lcub;
  Function task;
  std::tuple&lt;Args...&gt; args;

  void call() &lcub;
    std::apply(task, args);
  &rcub;
&rcub;&semi;
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note that <code>Job</code> is part of <code>ThreadPool</code> as each thread pool has it's own kind
      of job that it executes tasks of. In order to start a task, we must call the <code>call()</code>
      method and it will call the function using <code>std::apply</code> with the arguments that were
      passed when the <code>Job</code> was created.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small note, I didn't find another way to do this, we'll save the arguments as a tuple as we
      can pass our <code>Args</code> to the <code>std::tuple</code> template using the elipsis <code>...</code>
      to destructure them.
      We are using apply here, rather than just calling the function using <code>task(args)</code> so we can
      pass it the tuple.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="variables-explained">
    <h2>Variables Explained</h2>
    <p>
      We'll have a look at our variables. I believe they are self explanatory, however I will explain them
      for the sake of completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of the <code>ThreadPool</code> is we have a queue of tasks. Each thread will execute a task from
      it in a first come first serve (FIFO) manner. If there are no tasks to queue, the threads will sleep
      until they are notified of a new task, or are notified to stop terminate.
      The way we'll notify them will be using the <code>std::condition_variable</code>. The way we'll tell the
      threads to stop executing will be with <code>shouldTerminate</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also see we have an <code>std::queue</code> of <code>Job</code>s and a mutex to control
      threads' access to the queue (to make it thread safe).
    </p>
    <p>
      One note about this implementation. In the origianl, they used an <code>std::vector</code> to store the
      threads. However, we are using an array. This does mean that once you set the number of threads you cannot
      change it. If you really desire that usage, feel free to change the code accordingly.
      We are also not using a regular array like so:
    </p>
    <pre><code>std::thread threads[threadCount]&semi;</code></pre>
    <p>
      But we are using the <code>std::array</code> as I want the creation of the array to support
      both using variables and compile time known values.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="thread-pool-api">
    <h2>The API</h2>
    <p>
      We'll now cover the <code>start</code>, <code>queue</code>, <code>join</code> and <code>busy</code>
      methods. They are quite simple as the main part of the thread pool is the thread loop. So let's get
      to it.
    </p>
<pre><code>void start() {
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; threadCount; i++) {
    threads[i] = std::thread(&ThreadPool::loop, this);
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      To start the thread pool execution, we are telling all of our threads to start executing the loop
      function, giving it the context of <code>this</code>. You <em>could</em> call the start function
      directly in the constructor. Doing this, however, let's us first queue up all of the tasks before
      executing them. You can also call <code>start</code> directly after initializing the object.
    </p>
<pre><code>void queue(const Function& func, Args... args) {
  std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(queueMutex);
  
  Job job = { func, std::forward_as_tuple(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...) };
  jobs.push(job);
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      To queue a task, ignoring the syntax, we are just asking for the function handle (the same function that we have
      defined with <code>ThreadPool::Function</code>). Writing the signature like that lets us pass the arguments
      in the following manner.
    </p>
    <pre><code>pool.queue(func, 5, 3.14f, "Text");</code></pre>
    <p>
      This makes the code the user writes look nicer than passing an <code>std::tuple</code>. We are
      required to <code>forward_as_tuple</code> the arguments, but that's just a little bit more code
      for the api to make the usage much nicer :D.
    </p>
<pre><code>void join() {
  if (shouldTerminate) {
    return;
  }
  
  std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(queueMutex);
  shouldTerminate = true;
  lock.unlock();
  
  mutexCondition.notify_all();
  for (std::thread& activeThread : threads) {
    activeThread.join();
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>join</code>ing means "tell the threads to stop whatever they are doing, and stop executing any
      more tasks, even if there are nore tasks". As stated above, we can notify waiting threads that they
      can stop waiting for more tasks using the <code>condition_variable</code>. Thus, having threads waiting
      for new tasks, they can escape their lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are getting a lock, setting the <code>shouldTerminate</code> to <code>true</code> and <code>notify_all</code>
      of the threads waiting on the <code>queueMutex</code> with the <code>mutexCondition</code> condition variable.
      Then we are looping over all of our threads and we are telling them to stop executing once they can using
      the <code>std::thread::join</code> method.
    </p>
<pre><code>bool busy() {
  return !jobs.empty();
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Lastly, for our programs (to know if we are still executing tasks), we have the <code>busy</code> method
      that returns whether the <code>std::queue</code> still has tasks in it.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="main-thread-loop">
    <h2>Main Thread Loop</h2>
    <p>
      Now for the interesting part. Here's the heavy lifting part of the code. Before we can actually talk
      about the main thread pool loop we'll show how we are getting task to execute. We are doing so
      using the <code>getNextJob</code> defined:
    </p>
<pre><code>std::optional&lt;Job&gt; getNextJob() {
  std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(queueMutex);
  mutexCondition.wait(lock, [this] {
    return !jobs.empty() || shouldTerminate;
  });
  
  if (shouldTerminate) {
    return std::nullopt;
  }
  
  Job job = jobs.front();
  jobs.pop();
  
  return job;
}
</code></pre>
  <p>
    First, we're getting a lock on the <code>std::queue</code> by locking our <code>queueMutex</code> with
    a <code>std::unique_lock</code> which gets released automatically at the end of its life (and since it's
    defined on the stack, its end of life is the end of the task).
  </p>
  <p>
    We are then waiting using <code>std::condition_variable</code> until we are notified and the
    <code>jobs</code> queue is not empty or we <code>shoudlTerminate</code>. This will get triggered
    by a the <code>queue</code> and <code>join</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we finished waiting, we either need to stop executing, and then we are retuning a <code>std::nullopt</code>
    or we have another job to execute, and then we are taking it from the queue and returning it.
    This is another big (in my opinion) change in the code. In the original code we are using execptions and
    if we need to terminate we <code>throw</code> a proper exception that we'll catch in the <code>loop</code> method.
    Here we are replacing the <code>try-catch</code> with an <code>std::optional</code> return type - being an
    <code>std::nullopt</code> to terminate and a value to continue execution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's look at the main loop as we saved the best for last.
  </p>
<pre><code>void loop() {
  while (true) {
    std::optional<Job> job = getNextJob();
    
    if (!job.has_value()) {
      break; // out of the while loop.
    }
    
    job.value().call();
  }
}
</code></pre>
  <p>
    We are asking here for the next job using the method <code>getNextJob</code> we just explained.
    This will make our thread wait until there is a new job or we need to stop execution.
    If the result we are getting is a <code>std::nullopt</code> then we <code>break</code> out of
    the while loop. Otherwise, there's a value which is a <code>struct Job</code> and we can go ahead
    and call the <code>call</code> method of that struct.
  </p>
  <p>
    This concludes the <code>ThreadPool</code> class and it's implementation.
  </p>
