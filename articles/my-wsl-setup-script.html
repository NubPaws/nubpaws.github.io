	<h1>Motivation</h1>
	<p>
		As of late, I find my self purging my WSL distribution and installing it all from fresh.
		While doing so I backup my <code>.bashrc</code> file and then import it back to <code>source</code> it.
		After that, I always try and open up VSCode, doing so prompts me to install wget, so I start updating
		everything just to install wget.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, I can start working on my projects again, let me just run <code>git clone repo</code> and,
		oh right.. I need to install git, and I need to setup the credential manager to use the Windows one to
		make my life easier. So I google how to do that and then I can start working on my projects finally!
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, the more I work with Unix and WSL in particular, the more I see myself having more and more things
		that I will need to install on a fresh distribution and more and more things that I know I will need.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have created this page, to have a quick command I (and you) can use to setup WSL after a
		fresh installation.
	</p>
	<p>
		People have done it before, hosting the file on their GitHub page. I just make it a bit more available
		and easier to use for myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>IMPORTANT NOTE:</em> this script is nothing fancy, and you should always understand a script
		fully before running it. It will make you a more secure user, and it will elevate your expertise
		in the long run.

<section id="the-script">
	<h1>Running the Script</h1>
	<p>
		To get the script to run you can download it and run it using the following command. The script itself
		<a href="../files/my-wsl-setup-script/setup_shell.sh">can be viewed here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The funny thing is that to use the script you might need to have curl or wget already installed, which
		is part of what the script does. If you have any one installed just run the following command:
	</p>
<pre><code>bash <(curl -sSL https://nubpaws.github.io/files/my-wsl-setup-script/setup_shell.sh)</code></pre>
<pre><code>bash <(wget -qO- https://nubpaws.github.io/files/my-wsl-setup-script/setup_shell.sh)</code></pre>
	<p>
		If you have neither, I would advise install curl and then running the script, so the following command:
	</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install curl && bash <(curl -sSL https://nubpaws.github.io/files/my-wsl-setup-script/setup_shell.sh)</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="what-does-it-do">
	<h1>What does it do?</h1>
	<p>
		The script does the following actions:
		<ul>
			<li>Runs update, upgrade and autoremove on the system to get everything updated.</li>
			<li>
				Installs a bunch of software I find useful:
				<ul>
					<li>git</li>
					<li>curl</li>
					<li>wget</li>
					<li>build-essential</li>
					<li>gdb</li>
					<li>python3</li>
					<li>python3-pip</li>
					<li>python3-venv</li>
					<li>unzip</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Setups git credential manager assuming the newest version of Git.</li>
			<li>
				Adds a bunch of aliases like <code>update-all</code> that updates the system and
				<code>explorer</code> which opens windows file explorer in the current working directory.
			</li>
			<li>
				Setsup the variable <code>$DESKTOP</code> for the user's desktop folder which is always
				a nice place to jump to other projects on your Windows machine from.
			</li>
			<li>
				Setups the prompt to look like my prompt. You might not like it so it will be the last
				line in the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file to delete.
			</li>
		</ul>
