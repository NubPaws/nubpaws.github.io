		<p class="sub-title">What is this calculator for</p>
		<p>
			Assume you are playing a game in which there's a loot box you can open and there's an item in the
			loot box that has a drop chance of 0.2%. How many times will you have to open the loot box to
			guarantee a 95% chance of getting the item?
			<div class="spacer-half"></div>
			This calculate calculates exactly this!
		</p>
		
		<p class="sub-title">How does this calculator work</p>
		<p>
			You give the calculator two out of three inputs. It'll then calculate the third
			input automatically.
			<div class="spacer-half"></div>
			<ul>
				<li>Drop chance - the chance for the item drop (self explanatory).</li>
				<li>Success rate - the percentage of success you want to have of getting the item.</li>
				<li>Action count - how many times you need to repeat the action to achieve said success rate.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p class="sub-title">How do we actually calculate</p>
		<p>
			I'll assume a basic knowledge in Algebra and a basic knowledge in Probability.
			<div class="spacer-half"></div>
			
			More precisely, we'll be using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">Logarithms</a>
			and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">Binomial Distribution</a>
			to tackle this problem. You can read up on those two, or just trust the process.
			<div class="spacer-full"></div>
			
			We'll begin by denoting a few variables.
			<div class="spacer-quarter"></div>
			
			Let $p \in \left(0,1\right)$ be the probability of getting the item from each action.
			<div class="spacer-quarter"></div>
			Let $ c \in \left( 0, 1 \right) $ be the success rate we are interested in.
			<div class="spacer-quarter"></div>
			Let $n \in \mathbb N $ be the number of times we need to do the experiment.
			<div class="spacer-quarter"></div>
			One last assumption, we'll assume that the actions are <i>independent</i>. That is, we'll
			assume that each action doesn't affect any other action.
			<div class="spacer-half"></div>
			
			With the last assumption we made, we can use $X$ to denote a random variable for the
			number of times we have to do the action (open a loot box for example). We can then infer
			that:
			\[ X \sim \mathrm{Bin} \left( n, p \right) \]
			Meaning $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n, p$.
			<div class="spacer-half"></div>
			
			We want to have the probability of getting the item be greater than $c$, meaning we want
			the following to be true
			\[
			\Pr \left( X \ge 1 \right) \ge c
			\]
			However, this isn't an easy calculation to do optimally. We can still do it, and it wouldn't take
			much time, but we would always like a closed solution.
			<div class="spacer-quarter"></div>
			
			We can use the fact that $\Pr \left( A \right) = 1 - \Pr \left( A^c \right) $ where $A^c$ is the
			complement of the event $A$.
			<div class="spacer-quarter"></div>
			
			Using the complement we'll get that what we are really interested in is:
			\[
			\Pr \left( X \ge 1 \right) \ge c \iff 1 - \Pr \left( X &lt; 1 \right) \ge c
			\]
			And note that $X$ counts the number of times we do an action, and as we cannot do an acion a negative
			number of times, we know that $X \ge 0$ meaning that the expression above is the same as
			\[
			1 - \Pr \left( X = 0 \right) \ge c
			\]
			Doing a bit of algebra we get
			\[
			\Pr \left( X = 0 \right) \le 1 - c
			\]
			Since we know $X$'s distribution we can apply the formula to calculate it's probability and
			get the following:
			\[
			\binom{n}{0} p^0 \left(1 - p\right)^{n - 0} \le 1 - c
			\]
			\[
			(1 - p)^n \le 1 - c
			\]
			And now we can apply the logarithm base $1 - p$ to get the value of $n$. Note that $1 - p \le 1$,
			therefore, we must swap the in-equality symbol.
			\[
			n \ge \log_{1 - p} \left(1 - c\right)
			\]
			Finally, since $n$ has to be a whole number, we will round the result upwards to get that the minimum
			number of times we need to do the action, to get a $c$ success rate, is
			\[
			n = \left\lceil \log_{1 - p} \left(1 - c\right) \right\rceil
			\]
			<div class="spacer-full"></div>
			And that's the end :&#41;.
